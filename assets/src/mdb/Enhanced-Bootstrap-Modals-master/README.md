# Enhanced Bootstrap Modals

Set of responsive modals based on the latest Bootstrap 4 and jQuery that do not need MDB (Material Design for Bootstrap) styling to work properly.

They add new modal designs to a classic Bootstrap, such as:

- Frame modal  
- Side modal  
- Central modal  
- Fluid modal  

They come in different sizes and with different positions options as seen on the documentation page:
